# Example 4: Redpanda to Redpanda with Schema Subject Filtering
# Use case: Selective schema migration with latest version only
# Source: Redpanda cluster in testzone (redpanda-0.testzone.local:31092)
# Destination: Local Redpanda cluster (localhost:9092)
# Scope: Data and filtered schemas
# Consumer offsets: Enabled with 1-minute sync interval
# ACLs: Not migrated
# Schema filtering: Use include patterns to filter source schema subjects
# Schema versions: Only latest version (not full history)
