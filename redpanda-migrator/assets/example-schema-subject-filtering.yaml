# Example 10: Schema Migration with Subject Filtering (Include Pattern)
# Use case: Selective schema migration using regex patterns
# Source: Redpanda cluster in testzone (redpanda-0.testzone.local:31092)
# Destination: Local Redpanda cluster (localhost:9092)
# Scope: Data and filtered schemas
# Consumer offsets: Enabled with 1-minute sync interval
# ACLs: Not migrated
# Schema filtering: Include only schemas matching "hello.*" pattern
# Schema sync: Periodic (10 seconds)
